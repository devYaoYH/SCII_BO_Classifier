    "We treat each action as a multivariate vector of as many variables as there are unique structures, buildings and upgrades available for each race. Thereafter, we will have a multivariate timeseries matrix for each player in a game. This is where we should end up and the starting point for our subsequent classification.\n",

    "Thus, the problem is formalized as an instance of **Unsurpervised Multivariate Timeseries Classification**. We discretize our timeseries into 1-second steps (for a reasonable vector length at 600 per 10 minutes)."

    "## One-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the game progresses in discrete frames, we can use one-hot encoding for the sequence of actions taken. However, this greatly increases the length of the timeseries we consider a 10min game has roughtly 13,600 frames in the above example. Most of these frames however have empty action sequences. **To deal with this extremely sparse data, we collapse all gaps between actions and discard those frames.** Although this will affect our accuracy in small (but potentially important) variations to build order, as the name suggests, it is the *order* of actions taken that is of paramount importance. Furthermore, we can append and consider the timeseries of resources as a continuous measure over the duration of the game for improved metrics of how the game is progressing (e.g. dips in minerals and gas will occur when actions are taken)."

    "We also have packages for automated feature extraction for a time series, e.g. [tsfresh](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh) is a candidate. To reduce the multivariate nature of the timeseries matrix we ended up with, we can run this feature extraction on each row of our matrix (timeseries for a single variable) then flatten the results into a single vector for further classification."
